    <!-- The Problem -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Most businesses lose hundreds of hours a month to work that shouldn't be manual. Dragging files between platforms. Copy-pasting into spreadsheets. Compiling reports nobody reads until they're stale. Transferring data between systems that should already be talking to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not that your team isn't capable — it's that they're spending their capability on the wrong things.

    <!-- What We Build -->
    <div class="space-y-6 text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mb-20">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">What We Build</h2>
      <p>
        We design and build automation systems using tools like n8n, Make, Zapier, Python, and AI agents. The specifics depend on your stack and your problem — but the outcome is always the same: less manual work, fewer errors, and more time for the things that actually grow your business.
